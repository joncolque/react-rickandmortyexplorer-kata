## DEV

### `npm start`: Uses the URLs specified in the `.env` file.
### `npm run server` Run this command in a separate terminal to start the simulated backend.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# STRATEGIES

### Api middleware

This middleware manages data through the following flow:

![My Image Description](./readme-files/middleware.JPG)

- GET: Handles requests for character lists and individual characters.
- PUT: Used for updates, tracking history changes, deletions, and managing comments.
- json-server:
  - Contains three collections: character (for updates and deletions), history (for change tracking), and comment.
  - character and history collections store partial data to avoid redundancy.

### Site Reliability
In case `json-server` is unavailable:
- The Characters page takes info from rickandmortyapi.com
- An error 'Please, try again later.' will is display when attempting to modify data (character editing, deletion and comments)

In case `rickandmortyapi.com` is unavailable:
- For a new search query, the Characters page will display 'We are working to enhance our services. Please try again later.'
- For a cached search query, the Characters page will show cached data, managed by `useQuery`.
- Character editing, deletion, and comments functionality will remain operational because `json-server` is running, and any changes will reflect on the Characters page using cached data through `useQuery`.

### Routes
- Searching by browser path or by typing in the searchinput is supported.
- All pages are accessible via browser path.
- The `Edit and History pages` cannot be accessed via browser path if the character has been deleted.

### Extensibility
- History Timestamp: Timestamps can be added to history entries to show the relative time, e.g., "1 day ago." The structure updates from `{keyModified:"value modified"}` to `{keyModified:"value modified", timestamp:21341234444}`
- Comment Timestamp and User: Timestamps and user information can be added to comments in a similar structure to the history entries, such as `{message:"This is a message", timestamp:21341234444, user:"random user"}`

### Possible Improvements and Knowed issues
- Global Toaster Notification (Improvement): Adding a global toaster notification system to display alerts or messages across the application.
- Debounce for Search Input (Improvement): Implementing debounce functionality for the search input to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.
- Character Name Modification (Known Issue): Modifying a character's name works as expected, but the modified name is not searchable due to the R&M API’s lack of awareness of the updated name.
- Optimize Bundle Size (Improvement): Replace named imports with default imports in Material UI components, as recommended https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/
- File and Folder Organization and Names (Known Issue)
Reorganize files and folders to improve project structure and maintainability.

## BUILD

### `npm run build` uses URLs from .env.production
### `npm install -g serve`
### `serve -s build`  serves the static files
### `npm run server` in a separate terminal, to launch the simulated backend.

Runs the app serving static files.\
